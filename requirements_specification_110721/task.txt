Recently you played an important role in our testing. I wonder If you could help me one more time with our application testing. Weâ€™ve introduced a new functionality that requires requirements review, test documentation creating and analysis of already developed screen.

Kindly let me know in your reply your questions related to requirements, if any. Also provide me with the tests you would suggest. Additionally if you find any suspicious on the screen, highlight this to me. Requirements list and screenshot is enclosed to the e-mail.

Thank you for your support and looking forward to your reply.
